* Traffic Light Client for the Raspberry PI
This is an *Elixir* client that corresponds to our [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-server-elixir][Traffic Light Server]] and controls the lights of a modded traffic light, using three GPIO pins of the Raspberry PI.

In order to make the deployment and service management on the device as easy as possible I decided to try out the [[https://nerves-project.org/][Nerves Project]].

The real world traffic light consists of the lights itself (in the commonly known casing) that are controlled by a custom made shield for the Raspberry PI.

This project replaces an old [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-client-raspberry][Ruby version of the client]] that was running as a service on a Raspian installation.
** Deployment
Note that there are some environment variables required when building a release.

I set them automatically with [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] and a ~.env~ file. See the ~.env_example~ file for what is needed.
*** Initial Deployment (or Offline Deployment)
#+begin_src sh
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix firmware.burn
#+end_src
*** Follow up deployments
#+begin_src sh
mix firmware
./upload.sh
#+end_src
** Debugging and introspection
*** SSH into running client
Note that the client has to be in the same network ;)

#+begin_src sh
ssh nerves.local
#+end_src
*** Check outside connections from iex
#+begin_src elixir
tping 'google.com'
#+end_src
*** Get network information
#+begin_src elixir
Nerves.Network.status("wlan0")
#+end_src
*** Looking into the GenServer that updates the traffic light
First, you have to enable debugging of the genserver.

#+begin_src elixir
TrafficLightClient.Updater.enable_debug
#+end_src

Then you can use the following statements to introspect the process and look at the state.

#+begin_src elixir
:sys.get_status(UpdaterLink)
:sys.statistics(UpdaterLink, :get)
:sys.get_state(UpdaterLink)
#+end_src
** A little bit of Traffic Light history
This traffic light project exists roughly since 2011. I use this side project as a form of recreational programming and joyful overengineering.

The software/hardware project has seen many stages:
- Connected to a Synology NAS with a self-soldered [[https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?country=be&lang=de&id=351346][Velleman K8055]] USB experimentation board.
- Connected to a Raspberry PI, running a [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-client-raspberry][Ruby]] script locally, [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-server][node.js]] on the server side.
- Wiring mostly replaced by a [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-client-elixir/master/assets/doc/shield.jpg][custom etched circuit board]] - a Raspberry shield built only for the purpose of changing the traffic light (and debugging it at home without disassembling the whole traffic light).
- Replacement of the Raspbian/Ruby client with [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-client-elixir][Elixir and Nerves]].
- Replacement of the node.js server with [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-server-elixir][Elixir and Phoenix]].

The physical traffic light has been set up at two companies and four offices, motivating me and many others to keep your CI green and clean.

It also had [[https://traffic-light.tumblr.com/][its own dedicated blog]], showing the appearances of the traffic light in different articles and videos as it was a welcome guest in German media.
